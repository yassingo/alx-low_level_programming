Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
How to use arguments passed to my program
What are two prototypes of main that I know of, and in which case do I use one or the other
How to use attribute((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
